================================
Organization of the Code
================================

This chapter describes the organization of the code, provides instruction on the GitHub workflow and the code review process, and outlines the release procedure. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with using basic GitHub features. A GitHub account is necessary if a user would like to make and contribute code changes.

--------------------------
Authoritative Repositories
--------------------------

There are two authoritative repositories for the CCPP:

https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework

https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics

Users have read-only access to these repositories and as such cannot accidentally destroy any important (shared) branches of these authoritative repositories. Both CCPP repositories are public (no GitHub account required) and may be used directly to read or create forks. Write permission is generally restricted, however.

The following branches are recommended for CCPP developers:

+----------------------------------------+-------------+
| Repository                             | Branch name |
+========================================+=============+
| https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics   | master      |
+----------------------------------------+-------------+
| https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-framework | master      |
+----------------------------------------+-------------+

=====================================================
GitHub Workflow (setting up development repositories)
=====================================================

The CCPP development practices make use of the GitHub forking workflow. For users not familiar with this concept, this website provides some background information and a tutorial.

---------------
Creating Forks
---------------

The GitHub forking workflow relies on forks (personal copies) of the shared repositories on GitHub. These forks need to be created only once, and only for directories that users will contribute changes to. The following steps describe how to create a fork for the example of the ccpp-physics submodule/repository:

 Go to https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics and make sure you are signed in as your GitHub user.

 Select the "fork" button in the upper right corner.

      * If you have already created a fork, this will take you to your fork.
      * If you have not yet created a fork, this will create one for you.

 Note that the repo name in the upper left (blue) will be either "NCAR" or "your GitHub name” which tells you which fork you are looking at.

Note that personal forks are not required until a user wishes to make code contributions. The procedure for how to check out the code laid out below can be followed without having created any forks beforehand.

-----------------------------------
Checking out the Code
-----------------------------------
Instructions are provided here for the ccpp-physics repository. Similar steps are required for the ccpp-frameworkx repository. The process for checking out the CCPP is described in the following, assuming access via https rather than ssh. We strongly recommend setting up passwordless access to GitHub (see https://help.github.com/categories/authenticating-to-github).

Start with checking out the main repository from the NCAR GitHub

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics
   cd ccpp-physics
   git remote rename origin upstream

Checking out remote branches means that your local branches are in a detached state, since you cannot commit directly to a remote branch. As long as you are not making any code modifications, this is not a problem. If during your development work changes are made to the corresponding upstream branch, you can simply navigate to this repository and check out the updated version:

.. code-block:: console

   git remote update
   git checkout upstream/master
   cd ..

However, if you are making code changes, you must create a local branch.

.. code-block:: console

   git checkout -b my_local_development_branch

Once you are ready to contribute the code to the upstream repository, you need to create a PR (see next section). In order to do so, you first need to create your own fork of this repository (see previous section) and configure your fork as an additional remote destination, which we typically label as origin. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/ccpp-physics
   git remote update

Then, push your local branch to your fork:

.. code-block:: console

   git push origin my_local_development_branch

For each repository/submodule, you can check the configured remote destinations and all existing branches (remote and local):

.. code-block:: console

   git remote -v show
   git remote update
   git branch -a

As opposed to branches without modifications described in step 3, changes to the upstream repository can be brought into the local branch by pulling them down. For example (where a local branch is checked out):

.. code-block:: console

   cd ccpp-physics
   git remote update
   git pull upstream dtc/develop

.. _committing-changes:

==================================
Committing Changes to your Fork
==================================
Once you have your fork set up to begin code modifications, you should check that the cloned repositories upstream and origin are set correctly:

.. code-block:: console

   git remote -v

This should point to your fork as origin and the repository you cloned as upstream:

.. code-block:: console

   origin	      https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/ccpp-physics (fetch)
   origin	      https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USER/ccpp-physics (push)
   upstream   https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics (fetch)
   upstream   https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-physics (push)

Also check what branch you are working on:

.. code-block:: console

   git branch

This command will show what branch you have checked out on your fork:

.. code-block:: console

   * features/my_local_development_branch
     dtc/develop
     master

After making modifications and testing, you can commit the changes to your fork.  First check what files have been modified:

.. code-block:: console

   git status

This git command will provide some guidance on what files need to be added and what files are “untracked”.  To add new files or stage modified files to be committed:

.. code-block:: console

   git add filename1 filename2

At this point it is helpful to have a description of your changes to these files documented somewhere, since when you commit the changes, you will be prompted for this information.  To commit these changes to your local repository and push them to the development branch on your fork:

.. code-block:: console

   git commit
   git push origin features/my_local_development_branch

When this is done, you can check the status again:

.. code-block:: console

   git status

This should show that your working copy is up to date with what is in the repository:

.. code-block:: console

   On branch features/my_local_development_branch
   Your branch is up to date with 'origin/features/my_local_development_branch'.
   nothing to commit, working tree clean

At this point you can continue development or create a PR as discussed in the next section.

=========================================
Contributing Code, Code Review Process
=========================================
Once your development is mature, and the testing has been completed (see next section), you are ready to create a PR using GitHub to propose your changes for review.

-------------------
Creating a PR
-------------------
Go to the github.com web interface, and navigate to your repository fork and branch. In most cases, this will be in the ccpp-physics repository, hence the following example:

 | Navigate to: https://github.com/<yourusername>/ccpp-physics
 | Use the drop-down menu on the left-side to select a branch to view your development branch
 | Use the button just right of the branch menu, to start a “New Pull Request”
 | Fill in a short title (one line)
 | Fill in a detailed description, including reporting on any testing you did
 | Click on “Create pull request”

If your development also requires changes in other repositories, you must open PRs in those repositories as well. In the PR message for each repository, please note the associate PRs submitted to other repositories.

Several people (aka CODEOWNERS) are automatically added to the list of reviewers on the right hand side. If others should be reviewing the code, click on the “reviewers” item on the right hand side and enter their GitHub usernames

Once the PR has been approved, the change is merged to master by one of the code owners. If there are pending conflicts, this means that the code is not up to date with the trunk. To resolve those, pull the target branch from upstream as described above, solve the conflicts and push the changes to the branch on your fork (this also updates the PR).

Note. GitHub offers a draft pull request feature that allows users to push their code to GitHub and create a draft PR. Draft PRs cannot be merged and do not automatically initiate notifications to the CODEOWNERS, but allow users to prepare the PR and flag it as “ready for review” once they feel comfortable with it.
