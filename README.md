# ccpp-doc
This repository contains the technical documentation for the [GMTB](http://www.dtcenter.org/GMTB/html/)
Common Community Physics Package (CCPP).  A viewable version of the latest documentation resides
chttps://dtcenter.org/community-code/common-community-physics-package-ccpp/documentation).

## Notes to Developers
The documentation is generated with Sphinx, using the reStructuredText (*.rst*) files in the 
*CCPPtechnical/source* directory.  Output can be generated in HTML or PDF formats.

## Prerequisites

In order to create the technical documentation as described below, Sphinx and its 
extension sphinxcontrib-bibtex need to be installed on the system. If PDF output
is required, TeX/LaTeX must also be installed.

Sphinx can be installed in various ways (see
[https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html]([https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/installation.html])),
for example using Anaconda:
```
conda install sphinx
conda install -c conda-forge sphinxcontrib-bibtex
```

Comprehensive TeX/LaTeX distributions are provided for Windows, macOS and Linux.
For more information see [https://www.latex-project.org/get/](https://www.latex-project.org/get/).

## Creating the technical documentation

To generate the technical documentation:

1. Clone the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/NCAR/ccpp-doc.git
```
2. Build the HTML document.
```
cd ccpp-doc/CCPPtechnical
make html
```
This will generate HTML files in *./build/html*.
3.  Build the PDF document.
```
cd ccpp-doc/CCPPtechnical
make latexpdf
```
This will generate a PDF file *./build/latex/CCPPtechnical.pdf*.
